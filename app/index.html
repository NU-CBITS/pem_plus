        <h3>LINKING EARLY INTERVENTION COLORADO SERVICES AND OUTCOMES</h3>

        <h3>What is our research project about?</h3>
        <p>A major goal of early intervention is to help children join activities that take place in their homes and communities so that they can develop important skills for daily life. We have two new online questionnaires to more quickly understand how young children like yours do everyday activities. We want to know if these questionnaires are easy and useful for parents to fill out during service visits. We also want to try and use this information to learn how the services that your child receives through Rocky Mountain Human Services (RMHS) relate to his or her ability to do tasks and activities in daily life.</p>

        <h3>Who can join this research project?</h3>
        <p>You can join this research project if you are at least 18 years old and are a parent or legal guardian of a child who has been receiving RMHS early intervention services for 3 or more months, and speak, read and write in English or Spanish.</p>

        <h3>Why should I join this research project?</h3>
        By joining this research project, you can help us learn how RMHS services matter in the lives of young children with developmental needs and their families. You can also earn $10.00 by mail for about 30 minutes of your time and will get a summary report of your child’s current functioning.

        <h3>How do I join this research project?</h3>
        <p>It’s easy!</p>
